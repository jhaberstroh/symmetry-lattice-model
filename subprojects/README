INSTALLATION:
/ModelQT_GUI/bin/scripts must have the script for gnuplot in order for the gnuplot plugins to work. Or something like that.
TODO- put the scripts in /usr/local/bin/ to be called automatically by system(script). (but what about .gp scripts?)


TO COMPILE:

cmake .
make
cd ModelQT_GUI/bin
./ModelQT_GUI.exe
