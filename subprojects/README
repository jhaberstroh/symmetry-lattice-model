To compile:

cmake .
make

make will crash, and require that the user manually move ui_mainwindow.h into ModelQT_GUI/inc/ModelQT_GUI before the compile completes.

After building and linking, /Metropolis_Growth/scripts must be put in the directory of the executable (ModelQT_GUI/bin) in order for the gnuplot plugins to work.
