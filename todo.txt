RIGHT NOW:
added LogFile to orderparamfile.h, and implemented tracking of files. ctor in montecarlo.h should be working. Next up is to access logs in the GUI.


-setup a storage folder for filehandler
       -output .saved_locations to archive saves
       FILES TO LOCATE:
       	       -last order parameter data
	       -last order parameter image
	       -lattice image prefix & location

** How could this handle multiple instances of the exe at a given time?
   >> this number should never be more than 100... how can I track this?
      There are probably good string tokenizing methods that I don't know well, I'll figure this out at another time.


-better handle "too many files" problem (when it comes to saving the jpgs.)
	       



-see if it's possible to recursively grep for TODO: flags to add to this list :p
